				Just like your local community, CityHapps is growing and changing every day, and thus the Terms of Use are subject to change by CityHapps at any time. However, we’ll always let you know when the latest update occurred—just check the “Effective Date” on the bottom of this page. If you keep using the Service afterward, we assume that you have accepted the new Terms of Use.
			</p>
			<h2>1 Accounts</h2>

				<strong>1.1 Account Creation.</strong> In order to use certain features of the Web site (referred to collectively as “Services” herein) from the Web site), you must register for an account with CityHapps and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the Web site registration form.

			<h2>2 Use of Service</h2>
			<p>
				In order to comprehensively cover your community, the Service contains information on businesses, establishments, user generated content, public services and other third parties, as well as news, feature stories, images, video, audio and other materials. The Service may provide you with other ways to access and use such information and materials—for instance, we give you the option to receive our emails and bookmark our items in other social networking services. We try to ensure everything passes muster, but CityHapps makes no guarantee that any information provided or accessed on or through the Service is accurate, current or complete. Your use of the information we provide or that you obtain on or through the Service is at your own risk. If you think something looks fishy, please let us know. You agree that you will not hold CityHapps liable for any inaccurate, incomplete, outdated or missing information on the Service.
			</p>

You agree that CityHapps will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Web site or any part thereof.
				3.4 Ownership. You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in the Web site, including our rights to copyrighted material, patents, trademarks, service marks, and trade secrets (“Intellectual Property”) (excluding any User Content) are owned by CityHapps and its licensors, and neither the limited license granted in Section 3.1, nor our provision of the Web site under this Agreement shall transfer to you or any third party any rights, title or interest in or to such Intellectual Property. CityHapps reserves all rights not granted in this Agreement.
			</p>
			<h2>4 User Content</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>4.1 User Content.</strong> “User Content” of a Web site user means any and all information and content that such user submits to CityHapps by any means, including through social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), or uses with the Web site (e.g., a user profile, event submission or a feedback submission). You are solely responsible for your User Content. You assume all risks associated with use of your User Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness or usefulness by others, or any disclosure of your User Content that makes you or any third party personally identifiable. You hereby affirm, represent, and warrant that (i) you own, or have the necessary licenses, rights, and/or consents to use your User Content with the Web site as described herein and (ii) your User Content does not violate the Acceptable Use Policy (defined below). You may not state or imply that your User Content is in any way provided, sponsored or endorsed by CityHapps. Because you alone are responsible for your User Content (and not CityHapps), you may expose yourself to liability if, for example, your User Content violates the Acceptable Use Policy. CityHapps is not obligated to backup any User Content, makes no representation that it will do so, and you agree that CityHapps may delete User Content at any time.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>4.2 License.</strong> CityHapps is built to let you curate fun events, places and activities such as share and upload photos, videos, text, and other information (all of which we call “Your Content”). When you do this, you own Your Content except as you may otherwise agree. However (and here comes some legalese), by sharing or uploading Your Content, you grant CityHapps (and any of CityHapp’s contractors and licensors with respect to any of Your Content you provide to them through your use of our Site) a perpetual, worldwide license to use, redact, republish, copy, perform and distribute Your Content and your screen name, including, without limitation, any intellectual property contained therein, in any medium now known or hereinafter developed without payment or compensation to you and without seeking any further approval from you. We may also use your name, likeness, publicly accessible biographical data and any other information in connection with such use of Your Content. You acknowledge that our use of Your Content may include licensing Your Content to third parties and/or using Your Content for advertising purposes. In no event will we be required to seek your approval or provide you with any compensation in connection with any such uses. You acknowledge that nothing contained within Your Content would require us to seek permission of a third party in order to use Your Content as described in these Terms of Use.
			</p>
			<p>
				By submitting Your Content or using it with the Web site, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to CityHapps an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free and fully paid, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative works of, incorporate into other works, and otherwise use Your Content, and to grant sublicenses of the foregoing, solely for the purposes of including Your Content in the Web site, CityHapps social media platforms or marketing initiatives. You agree to irrevocably waive (and cause to be waived) any claims and assertions of publicity or moral rights, or attribution with respect to Your Content.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>4.3 Feedback.</strong> CityHapps will treat any feedback, communications, or suggestions you provide to CityHapps as non-confidential and non-proprietary. Thus, in the absence of a written agreement with CityHapps to the contrary, you agree that you will not submit to CityHapps any information or ideas that you consider to be confidential or proprietary.
			</p>

We may also remove or modify your User Content if it, in our sole judgment, violates the rights of, harms, or threatens the safety of any other person, or creates liability for us or any other person. In order to cooperate with legitimate governmental requests, subpoenas or court orders, or to protect our business and members, we may access and disclose any information we consider necessary or appropriate, including your CityHapps Account username and password, IP address and traffic information, usage history, and your User Content.

			</p>
			<h2>7 Disclaimers</h2>

				THE WEB SITE AND PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS” AND AS AVAILABLE AND WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

			</p>
			<p>
				CITYHAPPS DOES NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY THROUGH THIS SITE AND CITYHAPPS WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY MONITOR ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. IF A SUPPLIER PROVIDES AN EXPRESS WARRANTY, THAT WARRANTY IS BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER OR SUPPLIER AND NOT CITYHAPPS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF A SUPPLIER OF A PRODUCT PROVIDES A WARRANTY FOR THE PRODUCT AND ALLOWS US TO PASS IT THROUGH TO YOU, WE WILL PASS IT THROUGH TO YOU.
			</p>
			<h2>8 No Warranties</h2>
			<p>
				THE SERVICE, INCLUDING ALL CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE ON OR ACCESSED THROUGH THE SERVICE, IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER FOR OR WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTENT ON THE SERVICE. FURTHER, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN WILL BE COMPLETELY SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SERVICE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

AS USED IN THIS SECTION, “WE” AND “OUR” INCLUDES CITYHAPPS AND CITYHAPP’S CONTRACTORS AND LICENSORS.
			</p>
			<p>
				If any part of these warranty disclaimers or limitations of liability is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, or if we are otherwise found to be liable to you in any manner, then our aggregate liability for all claims under such circumstances for liabilities shall not exceed the lesser of (a) the amount paid by you for your use of the Service during the prior twelve (12) months or (b) ten dollars ($10).
			</p>
			<h2>9 Indemnity</h2>
			<p>
				You agree to indemnify and hold CityHapps, our officers, employees, agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, joint ventures, successors and any other companies under common control with us harmless, including costs and attorneys’ fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (i) your use of the Web site or Services, (ii) Your Content, or (iii) your violation of this Agreement.

You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of CityHapps. CityHapps will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.
			</p>
			<h2>10 Arbitration</h2>
			<p>
				You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your CityHapps purchase, use of any Service, or use of the Web site will be resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. You agree that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
			</p>
			<p>
				For all disputes whether pursued in small claims court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to CityHapps, Inc., attn.: Legal, We each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. If we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive this claim description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration. We each agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or the Agreement.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</strong> If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>JURY TRIAL WAIVER.</strong> If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, <strong>WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</strong>.
			</p>

			<h2>12 Intellectual Property</h2>
			<p>
				CityHapps respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users of our Web site do the same. Except as authorized in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, you are not permitted access or use of any of CityHapp’s Intellectual Property without our prior written consent or the consent of such third party that may own intellectual property with respect to Products displayed on the web site. In connection with our Web site, Products, and any services we offer, we have adopted and reasonably implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the removal of any infringing materials and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our Web site who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights, including copyrights. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed from our Web site, the following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li style="list-style-type: inherit;">your physical or electronic signature;</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: inherit;">identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been infringed;</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: inherit;">identification of the material on our services that you claim is infringing and that you request us to remove;</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: inherit;">sufficient information to permit us to locate such material;</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: inherit;">your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: inherit;">a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the objectionable material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or under the law; and</li>
				<li style="list-style-type: inherit;">a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact (falsities) in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>13.2 Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia excluding its principles of conflicts of law.

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>13.3 Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Web site and the use of any Services on our Web site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means including without limitation. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

			<h2>14 Offers, Promotions, and Customer Credits</h2>
			<p>
				CityHapps may from time to time and in its sole discretion make available special offers and promotions to its members, including offers and promotions that provide an opportunity for members to receive store credits, coupons, prizes, or benefits, (for example, referral credits issued to customers for referring others to CityHapps). Any such offers and promotions will expire on the dates specified in the offer or promotion. Credits, coupons, prizes, or benefits shall specify the terms that apply to their use and redemption and those terms shall apply. Credits, coupons, prizes, and benefits may not be combined with any other offers or promotions. We reserve the right at any time with our discretion, and without prior notice, to discontinue any offer or promotion or to add or change offer and promotion terms or conditions, including changing expiration periods or credit values for existing or future credits. Referral credits cannot accrue until or unless the referred customer completes a purchase on the Web site and all other conditions of the relevant promotion have been met.
			</p>
			<p>
				Credits are only for use on Services available for purchase on the Web Site and may not be used for the purchase of gift cards or services. Credits are promotional in nature without any exchange of money or value from you. Credits are not transferable to other accounts and as such, credits do not constitute property and you do not have a vested property right or interest in the credits.
			</p>
			<p>
				CityHapps reserves the right to suspend or terminate the account of any user it believes is engaged in fraudulent, illegal, or inappropriate conduct in relation to any offers or promotions, including without limitation, using multiple user accounts or email addresses to meet promotion or offer requirements, using false names, impersonating others, or engaging in any other fraudulent or misleading conduct. You agree to forfeit any credits, coupons, prizes, or benefits as a result of any fraudulent, illegal, or inappropriate conduct. CityHapps reserves the right to void any such credits, coupons, prizes or benefits granted if it suspects that these were derived in a fraudulent manner, a manner that violates this Agreement or the terms of the offer or promotion, or in a manner otherwise not intended by CityHapps. In addition, any fraudulent, illegal, or inappropriate conduct in relation to any offers or promotions, may subject you to liability for civil and/or criminal penalties under applicable law. If CityHapps terminates your account, for any reason, any credit balances in your account will be cancelled, except as prohibited by law. Account balances are determined by CityHapps and such determination is final.
